                  The health care sector in India is plagued with poor
                  infrastructure, long wait times, high diagnostic costs and
                  extensive travel for treatment. While 68.84% of the Indian
                  population resides in SLF areas, only 3% of medical
                  professionals are available in these areas. SLF poor fall
                  victim to unauthorized and unqualified medical practitioner
                  (quacks) who extract large sums of money for ineffective
                  treatment. Travelling to private hospitals located in urban
                  areas can be both tedious and extremely expensive. In urban
                  areas, quality treatment provided by private practitioners are
                  unaffordable for underprivileged people. Lack of proper
                  medical care makes the underprivileged communities vulnerable
                  to various diseases, affecting their quality of life, as well
                  as their very limited income.

                  SLF Health Care Foundation draws inspiration from the Late
                  Arun Nevatia (1965-2013), symptomatic of the undying spirit of
                  man. Diagnosed with Cancer at the tender age of 10, his early
                  days were spent through the pains of chemo-therapy and
                  radio-therapy. During this phase a sense dawned upon him that
                  it was the power of affordability in terms of good doctors and
                  expensive medicines that he is battling this disease, which is
                  beyond the reach of many.

                  An urge to reach out to the millions who have been deprived of
                  medical assistance due to poverty kept bothering him. This
                  urge made him uncomfortable, as a result of which he decided
                  to discontinue his business. All his present and future
                  financial achievements seemed to him to be completely baseless
                  since he realized that monetary gains will never bring him
                  true happiness. His urge turned to action. Along with his
                  elder brother Anant Nevatia, Arun founded RHCF, opening its
                  first primary health care centre at Mayapur in Nadia District
                  of West Bengal.
